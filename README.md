# ## Sales Analysis & Strategy for a Street Vendor (Driva Case Study)

### Project Overview

This project, developed as part of a challenge by Driva - Inteligência de Mercado, focuses on transforming raw sales data from a street vendor into actionable business intelligence. The core objective was to analyze sales transactions to uncover key trends and provide data-driven recommendations, ultimately helping the vendor optimize operations and boost revenue.

### Analytical Approach

The analysis leveraged Microsoft Power BI for end-to-end workflow, including:
- **Data Preparation:** Loading, cleaning, and shaping sales (`vendas.csv`) and product (`produtos.csv`) datasets using Power Query.
- **Data Modeling:** Establishing relationships between sales and product tables (linked via `ID_PRODUTO`).
- **Calculations & KPIs:** Creating calculated columns (e.g., quantity sold in kg) and key measures using DAX.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Designing a dynamic dashboard to visualize revenue trends, product performance, and sales patterns.

### Key Insights

The Power BI dashboard answered critical business questions for the vendor, such as:
- **Revenue Evolution:** Total sales reached R$ 160,000 over the analyzed period, showing clear seasonality and growth trends.
- **Best Sales Day:** October 26th stood out as the top-grossing day with R$ 2,365.34 in revenue.
- **Product Highlights:** Specific products, like Bananas (best sales on October 28th) and Laranja (highest quantity sold at 8,010 kg), emerged as major contributors.
- **Peak Hours:** Sales peaked at 07:00 and between 13:00-14:00, with slower periods from 08:00-10:00.
- **Performance Metrics:** The dashboard presents KPIs such as total revenue, average ticket per order (R$16.36), and total orders processed (9,806).

### Strategic Impact

Based on these insights, the following recommendations were proposed to enhance business performance:
- **Optimize operations** around peak sales hours and adjust staffing/inventory accordingly.
- **Launch targeted promotions** during off-peak times, such as "happy hour" deals to increase footfall.
- **Prioritize high-performing products** by ensuring consistent stock and marketing focus.
- **Increase average ticket value** using bundle offers and “leve mais por menos” promotions.
- **Run special campaigns** during historically weak periods, such as end-of-month “Virada do Mês” sales.

This data-driven approach empowers the street vendor with clear, actionable strategies grounded in robust analysis, supporting smarter decision-making and revenue growth.
